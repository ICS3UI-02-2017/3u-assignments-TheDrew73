Both statements behave the same way, this is because, for the first statement;
if karel can pick up a thing he will turn right. And if he cannot pick up a 
thing, he will turn left. And for the second statement; if karel cannot pick up
something then he will turn left, and if he can he will turn right. Thus in both \
statements if karel can pick up a thing he will turn right, and if he cannot
he will turn left.
